# I calculated what the x value of the pencil beam for the same y value would be 
# (e.g. If I am checking whether the point (-1,2) is in the epncil beam, I see at what
# x value my pencil beam starts at y value of 2). So in that case, I needed to apply
# PBC to every x value of the pencil beam I calculate, to make sure they are not off the
